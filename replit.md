# TrueView - Senior Living Community Transparency Platform

## Overview

TrueView is a full-stack web application that provides transparent, real-time data about senior living communities. The platform helps families make informed decisions by offering access to licensing information, inspection reports, and verified community data. The application features community search capabilities, detailed community profiles, and a claim system for community owners.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Development Environment**: Optimized for Replit with hot reloading

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and data fetching
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and CSS variables
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: Express.js with TypeScript for REST endpoints
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration
- **Web Scraping**: Planned scraping functionality for licensing data from state websites

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and user management
- **Communities**: Senior living facility information with comprehensive metadata
- **Inspections**: Inspection records with violation tracking and compliance data

### Key Features
- **Community Search**: Location-based search with filtering by care type, amenities, and pricing
- **Community Profiles**: Detailed pages with licensing status, inspection history, and amenities
- **Claim System**: Allows community owners to claim and manage their profiles
- **Transparency Scoring**: Rating system based on licensing compliance and inspection data

## Data Flow

1. **Search Flow**: Users search communities → API queries database → Results filtered and returned → Frontend displays cards
2. **Community Details**: User clicks community → API fetches full details and inspection data → Comprehensive profile displayed
3. **Claim Process**: Community owners submit claim form → Creates pending claim record → Admin review workflow
