© 2025 Scott Cowell. All rights reserved.

## Overview

TrueView is a full-stack senior living community search platform that prioritizes pricing transparency, real-time availability, and trusted reviews. The platform helps families make informed decisions by providing comprehensive community information including amenities, services, medical restrictions, and verified review sources. Key features include interactive map visualization, detailed community profiles with availability tracking, and a claim system for community owners.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Development Environment**: Optimized for Replit with hot reloading

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and data fetching
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives

- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: Express.js with TypeScript for REST endpoints
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect

## ⚠️ CRITICAL API COST PROTECTION IMPLEMENTED (January 5, 2025)
**Issue Identified**: Previous runaway API costs of $300+ from uncontrolled photo enrichment
**CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE**: Google Photos API made exactly **41,384 requests** in one day (227x expected volume)
**Cost Analysis**: 41,384 requests × $0.007 = $289.68 (matching the $300 burn)
**Loop Factor**: System hit error loops or pagination issues causing massive call multiplication
**Permanent Solutions Implemented**:

### 1. API Cost Protection System
- **Daily Limits**: $50/day maximum, 1000 calls/day
- **Emergency Stop**: Automatic halt at $75 total cost
- **Per-Operation Limits**: $5 per operation, 50 calls max
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Cost tracking before/during/after operations

### 2. Photo Enrichment Safeguards
- **Photo Limit**: Maximum 5 photos per community (reduced from unlimited)
- **Bulk Protection**: Checks total cost before enriching all communities
- **Individual Checks**: Validates limits after each community enrichment
- **Circuit Breaker**: Stops when less than $5 remaining daily budget

### 3. Monitoring & Control Endpoints
- `/api/admin/api-costs` - Real-time usage monitoring
- `/api/admin/api-costs/emergency-stop` - Manual emergency halt
- `/api/admin/api-costs/reset-emergency` - Admin reset capability
- **Audit Logging**: All API usage logged to `server/logs/api-usage.log`

### 4. Enhanced Rate Limiting
- **Google Places**: 3-second delays between community enrichments
- **Cost Validation**: Pre-operation cost estimation and approval
- **Automatic Shutoff**: Multiple safety nets prevent runaway costs

### Critical Discovery & Fix (January 5, 2025)
**FILTERING BUG DISCOVERED & RESOLVED**: Regional expansion system had overly restrictive Google Places type filtering
- **Missing Communities Found**: Eureka testing revealed "Especially You Assisted Living", "Alder Bay Assisted Living", "Silvercrest Residence", "Humboldt House Lodge Assisted Living" were filtered out
- **Root Cause**: `isSeniorLivingFacility` method required both senior keywords AND specific Google Places types ('lodging', 'health')
- **Fix Applied**: Permanently removed restrictive type requirements, now filters only by name patterns with exclusion list
- **Testing Confirmed**: Direct Google Places discovery now finds all 6+ previously missed Eureka facilities
- **Communities Recovered**: Successfully added 5 high-quality facilities with authentic ratings (3.5-5.0 stars, 5-8 reviews each)
- **Fire-Proofing**: Filtering system now prevents similar issues during rapid scaling expansion
