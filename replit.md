- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Development Environment**: Optimized for Replit with hot reloading
