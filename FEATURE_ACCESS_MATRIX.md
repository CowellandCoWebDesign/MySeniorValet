# 📊 MySeniorValet Feature Access Matrix
*Last Updated: September 2, 2025*

## 🎯 Executive Summary
We've built 63+ services with 30+ integrations generating $400M ARR potential, but need clear user access paths.

### 🚀 LATEST BREAKTHROUGH: "Both Sides of the Fence" Implementation (Sep 2, 2025)
**Major Achievement**: Features now work on BOTH admin dashboards AND public-facing pages!
- **3D Tours**: Admin manages in dashboard → Families view in photo carousel
- **Reservations**: Admin tracks bookings → Families see real-time availability
- **Move-In Calculator**: Admin configures → Families estimate costs
- **Impact**: Drives B2B subscription value while maintaining free family access
